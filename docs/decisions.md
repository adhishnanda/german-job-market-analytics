# Architecture Decisions

## 2026-05-27 — Initial scaffold

### Dependency pinning strategy
All packages in `requirements.txt` are pinned to exact versions (`==`).
Reason: scraping projects are brittle — a minor feedparser or bs4 bump can
silently change parsing behaviour and corrupt the historical dataset.
Trade-off: manual version bumps required; accepted given the small team size.

### Chart libraries: Plotly + Altair both included
Both `plotly` and `altair` are listed as dependencies because Streamlit has
native support for both and they cover complementary use cases (Plotly for
interactive drill-down, Altair for declarative layered charts). Whichever
works best for a given chart will be used; the other can be dropped later
without breaking anything.

### DuckDB as the only storage layer
No separate Postgres or SQLite. DuckDB handles all analytical queries
directly on `.duckdb` files stored in `data/db/`. This keeps the stack
self-contained — no server to run — and DuckDB's columnar engine is
well-suited to the aggregation-heavy dashboard queries.

### `data/` directories gitignored but scaffolded with `.gitkeep`
The `.gitkeep` files themselves are gitignored (parent dirs are in
`.gitignore`) so `data/raw/`, `data/processed/`, and `data/db/` will not
exist on a fresh clone. Fresh-clone setup step: `mkdir -p data/{raw,processed,db}`.
This will be added to README setup instructions when the first extractor lands.

### Stub pattern: `raise NotImplementedError`
Skeleton functions raise `NotImplementedError` rather than returning empty
lists. Empty-list stubs would let tests pass silently on unimplemented code;
`NotImplementedError` makes the gap obvious and forces the test to be skipped
explicitly (`pytest.skip`) until the real implementation exists.

### Airflow DAG: `@daily`, `catchup=False`
The DAG is set to run once per day with no historical backfill. Bundesagentur
and Indeed data is near-real-time; backfilling old dates would produce
incomplete snapshots anyway. This can be revisited once a stable historical
baseline exists.
